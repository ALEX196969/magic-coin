# magic-coin

You want to get out tonight and want to chose who decides where to go and what to do. Today me, next time you? No, you do not want the knowledge who decides to influence the decision to get out. Flip the coin? No, because you want to feel the result is predefined and does not depend on who, when, where and how flips the coin.
